# CSDS 133 Written Homework 1
**Instructions:** Each question is worth 10 points unless otherwise stated. Write your answers below the question. Only one answer is needed from a group unless otherwise specified. Each answer should be formatted so it renders properly on github. **Answers that do not render properly may not be graded.** Each person in each group must commit and push their own work. You will not get credit for work committed/pushed by someone else even if done by you. Each person is expected to do an approximately equal share of the work, as shown by the git logs. **If we do not see evidence of equal contribution from the logs for someone, their individual grade will be reduced substantially.** Please comment the last commit with "FINAL COMMIT" and **enter the final commit ID in canvas by the due date.**

1. Write a short essay (~300 words) about the positive impacts of data science on our lives. This could include some of the applications discussed in class, or other impacts you have read about elsewhere. Cite all sources appropriately.

3. Research one data science application (it could be one we have discussed in class) and write a short essay (~300 words) describing the application, the approach and results. Try to give details about the operational stack (how the data was stored, the file system, how it was queried and so on) if you can find the information. Cite all sources appropriately.
